Basic Calculator with Full Equation Display

***Project Description***

This is a fully functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Additionally, it includes percentage calculation, square root, and displays the full equation along with the result. 

This makes it easy for users to track their input and view the entire mathematical expression before the final result is shown.

The calculator is designed with a clean and modern user interface, providing an intuitive experience for users.

***Features***

*Basic Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

*Equation Display: Shows the full equation (e.g., 7 + 5 * 2) as the user types, and shows the result with the full equation when = is pressed.

*Percentage Calculation: Calculate percentages for input values.

*Square Root Calculation: Calculate the square root of the current input value.

*Clear Button: Clear the display and reset the equation.

***How to Use***

(1).Digits and Decimal Point: Enter numbers using the buttons 0-9 and the decimal point ..

(2).Operators: Use +, -, *, and / for basic arithmetic operations.

(3).Percentage: Press % to calculate the percentage of the current number.
       Let’s say the user types 200 + 20, and then presses the % button after 20:
        Before pressing %:
        fullEquation: 200 + 20
        currentInput: 20
        After pressing %:
        fullEquation: 200 + (20%)
        currentInput: 0.2 (since 20% of 100 is 0.2)
        The calculator will correctly reflect 200 + 0.2 in the result.
        
(4).Square Root: Press √ to compute the square root of the current number.

(5).Equals (=): Press the equals button to calculate and display the final result.

(6).Clear (C): Press C to reset the calculator and clear the equation.

***Code Structure***

*index.html: Contains the structure of the calculator.

*styles.css: Styles the calculator for a clean, modern look.

*script.js: Handles the core functionality of the calculator, including operations and user input.

***Key Functionalities***

(1)Full Equation Display:

The calculator shows the entire equation as the user types, which updates in real-time.

(2)Order of Operations:

The calculator respects the correct order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) when performing calculations.

(3)Percentage Handling:

When the % button is pressed, the current value is divided by 100, and the percentage result is displayed.

(4)Square Root:

The √ button calculates and displays the square root of the current number in the equation.
